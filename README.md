# GameDevelopment

This repository has my games that I have developed:
- Keyboard Fighters
- Worst Case Scenario




# Keyboard Fighters
  This is a game that tests ones ability to type using normal keyboarding skills. Enter the arena to take on a ascii fighter.
  
 


# Worst Case Scenario
  If you could choose one item to survive a plane crash in the middle of the ocean, what would it be? Now test your choice in this survival game.
